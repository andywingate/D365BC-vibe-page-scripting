## 🔐 MFA TOTP Support (NEW!)

**Problem:** Your organization requires MFA on all accounts, blocking automation.

**Solution:** Use TOTP (authenticator app) MFA with automated code generation.

### 👉 Complete MFA Solution

**[bc-replay-mfa-solution/](bc-replay-mfa-solution/)** - Everything you need to run bc-replay with MFA-enabled accounts:

- **README.md** - Complete documentation and setup guide
- **SOLUTION.md** - Technical details and approach

### What You'll Need

1. BC account with TOTP MFA enabled (authenticator app)
2. The TOTP seed from account setup (one-time capture - see solution docs)
3. Standard bc-replay installation **plus `otplib`** (`npm install otplib --save`)
4. 5 minutes to apply the patch

### What It Does

✅ Automatically generates TOTP codes during authentication  
✅ Works with Microsoft Entra ID MFA  
✅ Safe fallback for non-MFA accounts  
✅ No changes to your existing scripts
