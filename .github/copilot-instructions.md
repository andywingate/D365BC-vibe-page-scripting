# Business Central Page Scripting Project - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Purpose
This repository automates Business Central (BC) page testing using YAML-based scripts executed via Playwright. The repository is organized into two main areas:

- **`page-scripting/`** - Script generation and variant automation (PowerShell scripts and project folders)
- **`bc-replay/`** - Test execution and reporting (test runner and utilities)

**Core workflow:** Record a BASE script manually → Generate variants by substituting field values from data files → Test multiple combinations

## Critical Principles

### 1. Never Improvise BC Actions
**ALWAYS** request reference recordings before implementing new BC actions. The YAML format is generated by BC's page scripting recorder—patterns must match exactly or scripts fail silently.

### 2. Preserve Recorded Patterns
Use recordings as close to those generated by BC's page scripting tool. **Only change specific field values** that are part of your variant strategy (items, locations, vendors). Leave all other YAML structure intact.

### 3. Verify Field Dependencies
Location Code field requires Ship-to option set to "Location" (value: 1) BEFORE it becomes visible. Always verify dependency chain when adding new fields.

### 4. Keep Documentation High-Level
When documenting or explaining processes:
- Focus on what and why, not detailed how-to steps
- Signpost to resources rather than duplicating content
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid excessive detail—let users discover depth in linked resources

## Repository Structure

**High-level organization only:**

- **`page-scripting/`** - Scripts and automation
  - PowerShell generators (`Generate-BC-Script-Variants.ps1`)
  - Project folders (e.g., `PO Post DirectionsEMEA/`)
  
- **`bc-replay/`** - Test execution
  - Test runner (`npx-run.ps1`)

**Project Folder Convention:**
Each BC process gets its own folder inside `page-scripting/`:
- BASE Recording.yml (tested, working script)
- Data files (Items, Locations, Vendors - plain text, one per line)
- Process.md (business requirements)
- Variants/ (generated scripts)

## Key Workflows

### Generate Variants
```powershell
cd page-scripting
.\Generate-BC-Script-Variants.ps1 `
    -BaseScriptPath ".\ProjectFolder\BASE Recording.yml" `
    -ProjectFolder ".\ProjectFolder" `
    -OutputFolder ".\ProjectFolder\Variants"
```

### Execute Tests
```powershell
cd bc-replay
.\npx-run.ps1
npx playwright show-report
```

## Essential YAML Patterns

**Header Field:**
```yaml
- type: input
  target:
    - page: Purchase Order
      runtimeRef: b385
    - field: Buy-from Vendor No.
  value: "1000"
  description: Input <value>1000</value> into <caption>Vendor No.</caption>
```

**Line Entry (Repeater):**
```yaml
- type: focus
  target:
    - page: Purchase Order
      runtimeRef: b385
    - part: PurchLines
    - page: Purchase Order Subform
    - repeater: Control1
    - field: No.
  description: Focus <caption>No.</caption>
- type: input
  target:
    - page: Purchase Order
      runtimeRef: b385
    - part: PurchLines
    - page: Purchase Order Subform
    - repeater: Control1
    - field: No.
  value: "1896-S"
  description: Input <value>1896-S</value> into <caption>No.</caption>
```

**Additional Lines:**
```yaml
- type: set-current-row
  target:
    - page: Purchase Order
      runtimeRef: b385
    - part: PurchLines
    - page: Purchase Order Subform
    - repeater: Control1
  targetRecord:
    relative: 1
  description: Set current row in <caption>Control1</caption>
```

## Quick Validation Checklist

When creating/reviewing scripts:
- [ ] Have reference recording for each action type
- [ ] BASE script tested and works
- [ ] Data files validated against BC test company
- [ ] Field dependencies set correctly
- [ ] Only changed variable fields, not YAML structure

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Field not visible | Missing dependency | Set dependencies first |
| Script fails on re-run | Runtime ref changed | Use consistent BASE recording |
| Variant values not substituted | Data file name mismatch | Use expected names: Items, Locations |
| Test data missing | Data doesn't exist in BC | Verify all values exist |

## Testing Strategy

1. Build clean BASE script → Test manually
2. Create single variant → Validate substitution
3. Generate full suite → Only after confirmation
4. Iterate on failures → Fix BASE, regenerate

## Integration Points

- **BC Replay:** Playwright executor in `bc-replay/`
- **BC SaaS:** businesscentral.dynamics.com/{tenant}/{environment}
- **Authentication:** AAD with username/password (MFA disabled for test account)
- **Test Data:** Must pre-exist in BC company
- **Generation:** PowerShell scripts in `page-scripting/`

## When to Ask for Examples

Always request recordings for:
- New field types (dimensions, posting groups)
- New BC actions (approve, print, export)
- New page types (journals, cards, worksheets)
- Debugging unexpected failures

**Always prefer "show me a recording" over "let me try this pattern."**
